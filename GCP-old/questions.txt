Questions about scripts

1. Is this naming convention agreeable upon creating instances/clusters?
Single: tr-single-hagit-<machine name> #the hagit name is taken from the gmail account
Cluster: tr-cluster-min-hagit-<machine name>-node-1/2/3...

2. How many tags do you want as parameters?
Do you want to add static tags to created instances/clusters?

3. When creating an instance/cluster - do you also want to add the creator user as tag? if so, only his name? or email? or msg + email/name...

4. To which servers do you want to add the tags: 'do-not-terminate' and 'do-not-stop'?

5. I see there are 2 .yml files that ansible runs,
As I'm re-writing everything in Python I want your input on the new suggested scripts for instance/cluster deletion:

Will it be ok if I write 2 scripts,
one will delete an instance (run via parameter):
python delete_instance_script.py instance-name

The other will delete clusters via parameter:
python  delete_cluster_script.py cluster-name

Each script will look 1st if the do-not-delete tag is present.

Do you need anything else regarding those two scripts?

6. Can you explain what exactly the aws-unremovable-inst-mail.py script supposed to do?
